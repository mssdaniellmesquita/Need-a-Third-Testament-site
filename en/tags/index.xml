&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-1&#34;&gt;CHAPTER 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hi! I understand that it is impolite to read the letter which is for others, but this letter is for you, who found it out there after I threw it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hope these words are very useful to you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorry if I disturbed your rush, but my intention is to build you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ancient times, people had more time and did more things, and lived for more years, but in modern times people run a lot, feel that they have not produced enough and that time is lacking in every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nowadays people have great infrastructure and medical care, but in contrast the lifestyle and industrialized foods (snacks, fast food, etc.) have reduced people&#39;s life expectancy, while &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; foods are more expensive and considered, perhaps, by the majority as having a lower flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But speaking in ancient times: people were more dedicated to reading a letter they found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They read with humility, attention, interest, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ask that you be like this when reading this letter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When reading, you may think, &amp;ldquo;crazy!&amp;quot;, &amp;ldquo;Another one of those&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;tongue&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;liar&amp;rdquo;, but read it with much love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-2&#34;&gt;CHAPTER 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love and faith are gratuitous, and are the greatest things that exist in the Universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love is the greatest gift of beings, and faith is the greatest mover on earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about wisdom? Proverbs 4: 7: &amp;ldquo;Wisdom is the chief thing: get wisdom, use all that you possess in gaining understanding.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if all you have is faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is in faith that you can acquire wisdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James 1: 5: &amp;ldquo;And if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and casteth him not, and it shall be given him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If wisdom is the main thing, do I mistake in saying that faith is the greatest mover?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, for with faith one acquires the chief thing called Wisdom, so faith is also chief, all of these being important in their functions, as members of a body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Corinthians 11:11: &amp;ldquo;Neither is a man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Corinthians 11:12: &amp;ldquo;For as the woman is of the man, so also the man is of the woman: but all things are of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Corinthians 12: 20-21: &amp;ldquo;Therefore there are many members, but one body: and the eye can not say by the hand, I have no need of thee, neither yet head to my feet: I have no need of you &amp;ldquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking of a weaker member, and if that is your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your faith is small? Matthew 17:20: &amp;ldquo;And Jesus saith unto them, Because of your low faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: pass over thither, and pass over; nothing will be impossible for you. &amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not read this with debauchery, for obviously even though your faith is a giant, you can not move a hill, for it is not God&#39;s will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 John 5:14, &amp;ldquo;And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if you ask for something that is not God&#39;s will? James 4: 3: &amp;ldquo;Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask evilly, that ye may spend it in your pleasures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you ask for a good thing and not receive it? Do not think that you asked badly, nor give up; insist, for in the time of God he does for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus said in Luke 18: 7, &amp;ldquo;Shall not God execute judgment upon his elect, who cry unto him day and night, though he tarry with them?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read Matthew 17:20 again in this same letter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your faith small, the size of a mustard seed? Matthew 13: 31-32: &amp;ldquo;And he spake another parable unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto the grain of mustard seed, which a man hath taken in him, sowing in his field: which is the least of all the seeds; but it is the greatest of plants, and a tree is made, so that the birds of the air come and nest in their branches. &amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For if your faith is small, but you have faith!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And your faith can be exercised to grow much more, even in faith you may ask for more faith.&lt;/li&gt;
