[{"content":"CHAPTER 1  You do not know when this was written, nor who writes, but know who wants to talk to you. I do not know if you are a man or a woman. But what does it matter? You are reading, and you can build with it. I do not know your mistakes, your name, your surname, your schooling, your financial conditions; However, I direct this letter to any resident of Blumenau and neighboring towns, who may receive light by reading this. Daniell, a very flawed servant, I write this after contending and inclining to desires. I saw a wind like never before in Blumenau, dragging leaves and making a loud sound. I had thought of throwing this letter from a high place, but I was told that this is not necessary, and I have to write the letters without thinking of other things.  CHAPTER 2  I am perplexed about today's Christianity. Only talk about prosperity, victory, achievements, a fabulous life gifted, superb, etc. They teach people to be like the foolish; Of whom the Bible briefly referred, as also predicted what is happening today, in 2 Timothy 4: 3: \u0026ldquo;For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but with their ears itching, they will heap doctors for themselves according to their own lusts.\u0026rdquo; Who are these doctors? Pastors who preach prosperity today. And many churches do not want to admit losing believers to other churches (competitors, as if it were a capital competition) and then they preach only what pleases man, and so they fill their churches. But we can not speak pleasing man, but speaking what is fitting for building up people and souls to please God. 1 Corinthians 4:14: \u0026ldquo;I do not write these things to put you to shame, but I admonish you as my beloved children.\u0026rdquo; If I have a son that hinders him; I will allow him to do this within my house so that while he, alive, does not come out of it, Or with love will I rebuke him, lest he come out dead? It is similar to that which happens in the churches today. Do they prefer that the faithful keep their souls dying, or that they hear the truth even if they want to leave? What's the use of having the church full of lost souls? For the church with only seven saved members is better than a church with a thousand confused members. As it is written, many shall be called, but few shall be chosen. And: the door is narrow. Galatians 1: 9-10: \u0026ldquo;Now as I told you again, now I say unto you again, If any man shall preach any other gospel unto you than that which ye have received, let it be appart: for I persuade men now or to God? Or do I seek to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ. \u0026quot;  CHAPTER 3  Today is taught to crucify, not to carry the cross. Now, to have glory in heaven, must we have glory on earth? Is God unjust because the wicked are glorified on earth while the good suffer? Do Christians have to live as kings on earth? Has Christ ever returned, and here is paradise? Is here on earth heaven for the wicked and hell for the good? But the earth is not everything, and it is not here that it will be revealed to us what we are to be. For Earth, hell and heavens are similar, but different. 1 Corinthians 15:19: \u0026ldquo;If we hope in Christ alone in this life, we are the most miserable of all men.\u0026rdquo; For the one who, knowing Christ, sins; than he who sins in his ignorance. By those who say they love Christ, but their hearts are on the earth, And they give priority to things that are vanity (vanity are things that are not eternal), they are like the most sinful of all.  CHAPTER 4  Who sins more? The wanderer who can become a new creature, or what he says is a new creature and does not recognize his mistakes? For whoever claims to be already converted, and sinning voluntarily, He does not allow himself to become Spirit and truth, not word. Can he who says he has become converted convert himself without believing to have deviated from the path? For they live as deviants but claiming to be converted. And yet they want to repress whom they call sinners! What will we do about people like that? Teach them, admonishing with humility that comes from love, And fight in prayers for those whom we believe may come to repentance. As for us, let us not think that God and the Bible are equal to these hypocrites, their doctrines, and their churches. Let us love above all things, loving God above all things, Loving the neighbor more than we love, and loving us above the corruptions that this world offers; Gluttonies, drunking, smoking, sensuality, malice, envy and things similar to these. For these are evil to the body (the temple of the Holy Spirit) and to the soul. I am neither a priest nor a pastor. I do not consider myself a worker, because of so many failures. I have no church, I have no religion. But I ask that you receive this letter as receiving it from an apostle, knowing that I am not. May our greatest love be to Christ Jesus, so also shall we love the Father; for God is one. And if we love Jesus, we suffer with him, and with him we shall rise in glory. Galatians 1: 7: \u0026ldquo;Who is no other, but there are some who trouble you and want to disrupt the gospel of Christ.\u0026rdquo; Today, many churches are uneasy and scandalized; Being hypocrites on one side, disbelieving on the other.  CHAPTER 5  But he who is of God knows that in himself he receives the presence of Jesus and the Spirit, Who loves his neighbor and helps all, who seek to gather with other sincere Christians and admonish the wicked, Who seeks knowledge of the truth and is not embarrassed by the affairs of this life. Colossians 3:23: \u0026ldquo;Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as to the Lord, and not to men.\u0026rdquo; John 12: 42-43: \u0026ldquo;Yet many of the rulers believed in him; But they did not confess him because of the Pharisees, lest they be expelled from the synagogue. For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God. \u0026quot; Matthew 24:35: \u0026ldquo;Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 24: 38-39: \u0026ldquo;For as in the days before the flood they did eat, drink, marry, and marry, until the day that Noah entered into the ark. And they did not perceive it, until the flood came, and brought them all, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. \u0026quot; And why do those who say they are converted but sinners sin? John 9: 39-41: \u0026ldquo;And Jesus said unto him, I have come into this world for judgment, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may be blind. \u0026quot; And the Pharisees that were with him heard it, and said unto him, Are we also blind? Jesus said to them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin; but as you now say, we see; therefore your sin remains. \u0026quot; Galatians 5:14: \u0026ldquo;Let the whole law be fulfilled in one word, in this: thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u0026rdquo; Romans 6:12: \u0026ldquo;Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in its lusts.\u0026rdquo; 2 Corinthians 2:17: \u0026ldquo;For we are not as many as counterfeiters of the word of God, but we speak of Christ sincerely, as of God in the presence of God.\u0026rdquo; Read also Galatians 5: 17-25, and Philippians 4. As a man, I got very tired writing this letter, but my spirit rejoices. Read with love and diligence all the biblical quotations contained herein. Grace and peace, and love, be with you. mssdaniellmesquita@gmail.com Blumenau, 03/15/18  ","id":0,"section":"post","summary":"CHAPTER 1  You do not know when this was written, nor who writes, but know who wants to talk to you.

I understand that it is impolite to read the letter which is for others, but this letter is for you, who found it out there after I threw it. I hope these words are very useful to you! Sorry if I disturbed your rush, but my intention is to build you. In ancient times, people had more time and did more things, and lived for more years, but in modern times people run a lot, feel that they have not produced enough and that time is lacking in every day. Nowadays people have great infrastructure and medical care, but in contrast the lifestyle and industrialized foods (snacks, fast food, etc.) have reduced people's life expectancy, while \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo; foods are more expensive and considered, perhaps, by the majority as having a lower flavor. But speaking in ancient times: people were more dedicated to reading a letter they found. They read with humility, attention, interest, etc. I ask that you be like this when reading this letter. When reading, you may think, \u0026ldquo;crazy!\u0026quot;, \u0026ldquo;Another one of those\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;tongue\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;liar\u0026rdquo;, but read it with much love.  CHAPTER 2  Love and faith are gratuitous, and are the greatest things that exist in the Universe. Love is the greatest gift of beings, and faith is the greatest mover on earth. What about wisdom? Proverbs 4: 7: \u0026ldquo;Wisdom is the chief thing: get wisdom, use all that you possess in gaining understanding.\u0026rdquo; And if all you have is faith? It is in faith that you can acquire wisdom. James 1: 5: \u0026ldquo;And if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and casteth him not, and it shall be given him.\u0026rdquo; If wisdom is the main thing, do I mistake in saying that faith is the greatest mover? No, for with faith one acquires the chief thing called Wisdom, so faith is also chief, all of these being important in their functions, as members of a body. 1 Corinthians 11:11: \u0026ldquo;Neither is a man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.\u0026rdquo; 1 Corinthians 11:12: \u0026ldquo;For as the woman is of the man, so also the man is of the woman: but all things are of God.\u0026rdquo; 1 Corinthians 12: 20-21: \u0026ldquo;Therefore there are many members, but one body: and the eye can not say by the hand, I have no need of thee, neither yet head to my feet: I have no need of you \u0026ldquo;. Thinking of a weaker member, and if that is your faith? If your faith is small? Matthew 17:20: \u0026ldquo;And Jesus saith unto them, Because of your low faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: pass over thither, and pass over; nothing will be impossible for you. \u0026quot; Do not read this with debauchery, for obviously even though your faith is a giant, you can not move a hill, for it is not God's will. 1 John 5:14, \u0026ldquo;And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us.\u0026rdquo; What if you ask for something that is not God's will? James 4: 3: \u0026ldquo;Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask evilly, that ye may spend it in your pleasures.\u0026rdquo; Did you ask for a good thing and not receive it? Do not think that you asked badly, nor give up; insist, for in the time of God he does for you. Jesus said in Luke 18: 7, \u0026ldquo;Shall not God execute judgment upon his elect, who cry unto him day and night, though he tarry with them?\u0026rdquo; Read Matthew 17:20 again in this same letter. Is your faith small, the size of a mustard seed? Matthew 13: 31-32: \u0026ldquo;And he spake another parable unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto the grain of mustard seed, which a man hath taken in him, sowing in his field: which is the least of all the seeds; but it is the greatest of plants, and a tree is made, so that the birds of the air come and nest in their branches. \u0026quot; For if your faith is small, but you have faith! And your faith can be exercised to grow much more, even in faith you may ask for more faith. mssdaniellmesquita@gmail.com  ","id":1,"section":"post","summary":"CHAPTER 1  Hi!
