I understand that it is impolite to read the letter which is for others, but this letter is for you, who found it out there after I threw it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI hope these words are very useful to you!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSorry if I disturbed your rush, but my intention is to build you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn ancient times, people had more time and did more things, and lived for more years, but in modern times people run a lot, feel that they have not produced enough and that time is lacking in every day.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNowadays people have great infrastructure and medical care, but in contrast the lifestyle and industrialized foods (snacks, fast food, etc.) have reduced people's life expectancy, while \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo; foods are more expensive and considered, perhaps, by the majority as having a lower flavor.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBut speaking in ancient times: people were more dedicated to reading a letter they found.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey read with humility, attention, interest, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI ask that you be like this when reading this letter.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen reading, you may think, \u0026ldquo;crazy!\u0026quot;, \u0026ldquo;Another one of those\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;tongue\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;liar\u0026rdquo;, but read it with much love.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"chapter-2\"\u003eCHAPTER 2\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLove and faith are gratuitous, and are the greatest things that exist in the Universe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLove is the greatest gift of beings, and faith is the greatest mover on earth.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat about wisdom? Proverbs 4: 7: \u0026ldquo;Wisdom is the chief thing: get wisdom, use all that you possess in gaining understanding.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd if all you have is faith?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt is in faith that you can acquire wisdom.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJames 1: 5: \u0026ldquo;And if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and casteth him not, and it shall be given him.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf wisdom is the main thing, do I mistake in saying that faith is the greatest mover?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo, for with faith one acquires the chief thing called Wisdom, so faith is also chief, all of these being important in their functions, as members of a body.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 Corinthians 11:11: \u0026ldquo;Neither is a man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 Corinthians 11:12: \u0026ldquo;For as the woman is of the man, so also the man is of the woman: but all things are of God.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 Corinthians 12: 20-21: \u0026ldquo;Therefore there are many members, but one body: and the eye can not say by the hand, I have no need of thee, neither yet head to my feet: I have no need of you \u0026ldquo;.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThinking of a weaker member, and if that is your faith?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf your faith is small? Matthew 17:20: \u0026ldquo;And Jesus saith unto them, Because of your low faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: pass over thither, and pass over; nothing will be impossible for you. \u0026quot;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDo not read this with debauchery, for obviously even though your faith is a giant, you can not move a hill, for it is not God's will.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 John 5:14, \u0026ldquo;And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat if you ask for something that is not God's will? James 4: 3: \u0026ldquo;Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask evilly, that ye may spend it in your pleasures.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid you ask for a good thing and not receive it? Do not think that you asked badly, nor give up; insist, for in the time of God he does for you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJesus said in Luke 18: 7, \u0026ldquo;Shall not God execute judgment upon his elect, who cry unto him day and night, though he tarry with them?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRead Matthew 17:20 again in this same letter.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIs your faith small, the size of a mustard seed? Matthew 13: 31-32: \u0026ldquo;And he spake another parable unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto the grain of mustard seed, which a man hath taken in him, sowing in his field: which is the least of all the seeds; but it is the greatest of plants, and a tree is made, so that the birds of the air come and nest in their branches. \u0026quot;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor if your faith is small, but you have faith!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd your faith can be exercised to grow much more, even in faith you may ask for more faith.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:mssdaniellmesquita@gmail.com\"\u003emssdaniellmesquita@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n"
