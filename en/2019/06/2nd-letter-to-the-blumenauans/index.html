    <p><img src="../../../../img/letters/blumenauans/2.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="chapter-1">CHAPTER 1</h3>
<p>(1.) You do not know when this was written, nor who writes, but know who wants to talk to you.</p>
<p>(2.) I do not know if you are a man or a woman.</p>
<p>(3.) But what does it matter? You are reading, and you can build with it.</p>
<p>(4.) I do not know your mistakes, your name, your surname, your schooling, your financial conditions;</p>
<p>(5.) However, I direct this letter to any resident of Blumenau and neighboring towns, who may receive light by reading this.</p>
<p>(6.) Daniell, a very flawed servant, I write this after contending and inclining to desires.</p>
<p>(7.) I saw a wind like never before in Blumenau, dragging leaves and making a loud sound.</p>
<p>(8.) I had thought of throwing this letter from a high place, but I was told that this is not necessary, and I have to write the letters without thinking of other things.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-2">CHAPTER 2</h3>
<p>(1.) I am perplexed about today&rsquo;s Christianity.</p>
<p>(2.) Only talk about prosperity, victory, achievements, a fabulous life gifted, superb, etc.</p>
<p>(3.) They teach people to be like the foolish;</p>
<p>(4.) Of whom the Bible briefly referred, as also predicted what is happening today, in 2 Timothy 4: 3:</p>
<p>(5.) &ldquo;For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but with their ears itching, they will heap doctors for themselves according to their own lusts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(6.) Who are these doctors? Pastors who preach prosperity today.</p>
<p>(7.) And many churches do not want to admit losing believers to other churches</p>
<p>(8.) (competitors, as if it were a capital competition) and then they preach only what pleases man, and so they fill their churches.</p>
<p>(9.) But we can not speak pleasing man, but speaking what is fitting for building up people and souls to please God.</p>
<p>(10.) 1 Corinthians 4:14: &ldquo;I do not write these things to put you to shame, but I admonish you as my beloved children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(11.) If I have a son that hinders him;</p>
<p>(12.) I will allow him to do this within my house so that while he, alive, does not come out of it,</p>
<p>(13.) Or with love will I rebuke him, lest he come out dead?</p>
<p>(14.) It is similar to that which happens in the churches today.</p>
<p>(15.) Do they prefer that the faithful keep their souls dying, or that they hear the truth even if they want to leave?</p>
<p>(16.) What&rsquo;s the use of having the church full of lost souls?</p>
<p>(17.) For the church with only seven saved members is better than a church with a thousand confused members.</p>
<p>(18.) As it is written, many shall be called, but few shall be chosen.</p>
<p>(19.) And: the door is narrow.</p>
<p>(20.) Galatians 1: 9-10: &ldquo;Now as I told you again, now I say unto you again, If any man shall preach any other gospel unto you than that which ye have received, let it be appart: for I persuade men now or to God? Or do I seek to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ. &quot;</p>
<h3 id="chapter-3">CHAPTER 3</h3>
<p>(1.) Today is taught to crucify, not to carry the cross.</p>
<p>(2.) Now, to have glory in heaven, must we have glory on earth?</p>
<p>(3.) Is God unjust because the wicked are glorified on earth while the good suffer?</p>
<p>(4.) Do Christians have to live as kings on earth?</p>
<p>(5.) Has Christ ever returned, and here is paradise?</p>
<p>(6.) Is here on earth heaven for the wicked and hell for the good?</p>
<p>(7.) But the earth is not everything, and it is not here that it will be revealed to us what we are to be.</p>
<p>(8.) For Earth, hell and heavens are similar, but different.</p>
<p>(9.) 1 Corinthians 15:19: &ldquo;If we hope in Christ alone in this life, we are the most miserable of all men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(10.) For the one who, knowing Christ, sins; than he who sins in his ignorance.</p>
<p>(11.) By those who say they love Christ, but their hearts are on the earth,</p>
<p>(12.) And they give priority to things that are vanity (vanity are things that are not eternal), they are like the most sinful of all.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-4">CHAPTER 4</h3>
<p>(1.) Who sins more? The wanderer who can become a new creature, or what he says is a new creature and does not recognize his mistakes?</p>
<p>(2.) For whoever claims to be already converted, and sinning voluntarily,</p>
<p>(3.) He does not allow himself to become Spirit and truth, not word.</p>
<p>(4.) Can he who says he has become converted convert himself without believing to have deviated from the path?</p>
<p>(5.) For they live as deviants but claiming to be converted.</p>
<p>(6.) And yet they want to repress whom they call sinners!</p>
<p>(7.) What will we do about people like that? Teach them, admonishing with humility that comes from love,</p>
<p>(8.) And fight in prayers for those whom we believe may come to repentance.</p>
<p>(9.) As for us, let us not think that God and the Bible are equal to these hypocrites, their doctrines, and their churches.</p>
<p>(10.) Let us love above all things, loving God above all things,</p>
<p>(11.) Loving the neighbor more than we love, and loving us above the corruptions that this world offers;</p>
<p>(12.) Gluttonies, drunking, smoking, sensuality, malice, envy and things similar to these.</p>
<p>(13.) For these are evil to the body (the temple of the Holy Spirit) and to the soul.</p>
<p>(14.) I am neither a priest nor a pastor. I do not consider myself a worker, because of so many failures.</p>
<p>(15.) I have no church, I have no religion.</p>
<p>(16.) But I ask that you receive this letter as receiving it from an apostle, knowing that I am not.</p>
<p>(17.) May our greatest love be to Christ Jesus, so also shall we love the Father; for God is one.</p>
<p>(18.) And if we love Jesus, we suffer with him, and with him we shall rise in glory.</p>
<p>(19.) Galatians 1: 7: &ldquo;Who is no other, but there are some who trouble you and want to disrupt the gospel of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(20.) Today, many churches are uneasy and scandalized;</p>
<p>(21.) Being hypocrites on one side, disbelieving on the other.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-5">CHAPTER 5</h3>
<p>(1.) But he who is of God knows that in himself he receives the presence of Jesus and the Spirit,</p>
<p>(2.) Who loves his neighbor and helps all, who seek to gather with other sincere Christians and admonish the wicked,</p>
<p>(3.) Who seeks knowledge of the truth and is not embarrassed by the affairs of this life.</p>
<p>(4.) Colossians 3:23: &ldquo;Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as to the Lord, and not to men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(5.) John 12: 42-43: &ldquo;Yet many of the rulers believed in him;</p>
<p>(6.) But they did not confess him because of the Pharisees, lest they be expelled from the synagogue.</p>
<p>(7.) For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God. &quot;</p>
<p>(8.) Matthew 24:35: &ldquo;Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(9.) Matthew 24: 38-39: &ldquo;For as in the days before the flood they did eat, drink, marry, and marry, until the day that Noah entered into the ark.</p>
<p>(10.) And they did not perceive it, until the flood came, and brought them all, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. &quot;</p>
<p>(11.) And why do those who say they are converted but sinners sin?</p>
<p>(12.) John 9: 39-41: &ldquo;And Jesus said unto him,</p>
<p>(13.) I have come into this world for judgment, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may be blind. &quot;</p>
<p>(14.) And the Pharisees that were with him heard it, and said unto him,</p>
<p>(15.) Are we also blind? Jesus said to them,</p>
<p>(16.) If ye were blind, ye would have no sin; but as you now say, we see; therefore your sin remains. &quot;</p>
<p>(17.) Galatians 5:14: &ldquo;Let the whole law be fulfilled in one word, in this: thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(18.) Romans 6:12: &ldquo;Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in its lusts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(19.) 2 Corinthians 2:17: &ldquo;For we are not as many as counterfeiters of the word of God, but we speak of Christ sincerely, as of God in the presence of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(20.) Read also Galatians 5: 17-25, and Philippians 4.</p>
<p>(21.) As a man, I got very tired writing this letter, but my spirit rejoices.</p>
<p>(22.) Read with love and diligence all the biblical quotations contained herein.</p>
<p>(23.) Grace and peace, and love, be with you.</p>
