<h3 id="chapter-1">CHAPTER 1</h3>
<ol>
<li>Hi! I understand that it is impolite to read the letter which is for others, but this letter is for you, who found it out there after I threw it.</li>
<li>I hope these words are very useful to you!</li>
<li>Sorry if I disturbed your rush, but my intention is to build you.</li>
<li>In ancient times, people had more time and did more things, and lived for more years, but in modern times people run a lot, feel that they have not produced enough and that time is lacking in every day.</li>
<li>Nowadays people have great infrastructure and medical care, but in contrast the lifestyle and industrialized foods (snacks, fast food, etc.) have reduced people's life expectancy, while &ldquo;fit&rdquo; foods are more expensive and considered, perhaps, by the majority as having a lower flavor.</li>
<li>But speaking in ancient times: people were more dedicated to reading a letter they found.</li>
<li>They read with humility, attention, interest, etc.</li>
<li>I ask that you be like this when reading this letter.</li>
<li>When reading, you may think, &ldquo;crazy!&quot;, &ldquo;Another one of those&rdquo;, &ldquo;tongue&rdquo;, &ldquo;liar&rdquo;, but read it with much love.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="chapter-2">CHAPTER 2</h3>
<ol>
<li>Love and faith are gratuitous, and are the greatest things that exist in the Universe.</li>
<li>Love is the greatest gift of beings, and faith is the greatest mover on earth.</li>
<li>What about wisdom? Proverbs 4: 7: &ldquo;Wisdom is the chief thing: get wisdom, use all that you possess in gaining understanding.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And if all you have is faith?</li>
<li>It is in faith that you can acquire wisdom.</li>
<li>James 1: 5: &ldquo;And if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and casteth him not, and it shall be given him.&rdquo;</li>
<li>If wisdom is the main thing, do I mistake in saying that faith is the greatest mover?</li>
<li>No, for with faith one acquires the chief thing called Wisdom, so faith is also chief, all of these being important in their functions, as members of a body.</li>
<li>1 Corinthians 11:11: &ldquo;Neither is a man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.&rdquo;</li>
<li>1 Corinthians 11:12: &ldquo;For as the woman is of the man, so also the man is of the woman: but all things are of God.&rdquo;</li>
<li>1 Corinthians 12: 20-21: &ldquo;Therefore there are many members, but one body: and the eye can not say by the hand, I have no need of thee, neither yet head to my feet: I have no need of you &ldquo;.</li>
<li>Thinking of a weaker member, and if that is your faith?</li>
<li>If your faith is small? Matthew 17:20: &ldquo;And Jesus saith unto them, Because of your low faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: pass over thither, and pass over; nothing will be impossible for you. &quot;</li>
<li>Do not read this with debauchery, for obviously even though your faith is a giant, you can not move a hill, for it is not God's will.</li>
<li>1 John 5:14, &ldquo;And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us.&rdquo;</li>
<li>What if you ask for something that is not God's will? James 4: 3: &ldquo;Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask evilly, that ye may spend it in your pleasures.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Did you ask for a good thing and not receive it? Do not think that you asked badly, nor give up; insist, for in the time of God he does for you.</li>
<li>Jesus said in Luke 18: 7, &ldquo;Shall not God execute judgment upon his elect, who cry unto him day and night, though he tarry with them?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Read Matthew 17:20 again in this same letter.</li>
<li>Is your faith small, the size of a mustard seed? Matthew 13: 31-32: &ldquo;And he spake another parable unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto the grain of mustard seed, which a man hath taken in him, sowing in his field: which is the least of all the seeds; but it is the greatest of plants, and a tree is made, so that the birds of the air come and nest in their branches. &quot;</li>
<li>For if your faith is small, but you have faith!</li>
<li>And your faith can be exercised to grow much more, even in faith you may ask for more faith.</li>
